This code represents a metro gate system using the State design pattern. It simulates a gate with three states: "Open," "Close," and "Processing," each represented by a separate class. The `Gate` class serves as the context and delegates actions to the current state. This design demonstrates the State pattern by encapsulating state-specific behavior, allowing dynamic state transitions, promoting low coupling between context and states, and enabling easy extensibility without modifying existing code.
